# James Taylor's Neovim Config

I'm using [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) as my base configuration for my Neovim setup and [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as the plugin manager. My goal is a lightweight, performant, and highly customizable development environment that supports multiple programming languages and workflows.
